# CS-230
SNHU submission for CS-230
Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room as a client requested their game for Android, Draw It or Lose It, to be developed for croos-platform. The application needed to a web-based solution. Requirements included multiple unique teams, real-time rendering, singleton instance of the game, and setting up the environment for design and development.  

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
My analysis of the design constraints was particularly well executed and I thought my recommendations were appropriate given the lack of specifications and budget restrictions. Given the brevity, all core needs were mentioned with portential solutions.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The domain model and UML diagram that was expanded upon provided the most direct benefit to code development.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would elaborate more on the distributed systems and networks section and  the client-side. Different protocols could be evaluated along with the depth of WebSockets. Going into the intracacies of client-side communication with a Linux server would be educational for potential pitfalls when developing for multiple platforms.  

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user’s needs by considering the requirements of The Gaming Room and focusing on the end-users of Draw It or Lose It. By keeping the user's needs at the forefront, I ensured the software would be functional, efficient, and performative even for those with lesser connection availability. It's vital to prioritize the user's needs because they determine the software's success. If the software doesn't cater to its intended users, it will fail, regardless of how technically sound it might be.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
My approach was methodical, starting with understanding the requirements and then diving deep into each component, from operating platforms to security. For future software applications, I'd employ strategies such as: User Stories, Agile, Iterative design, and User-driven development.
